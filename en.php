$p1_1="VLAB is a web application that offers to its users an interactive environment for understanding in depth the basic principles of Process Control Theory.";
$p1_2="This virtual lab consists of a series of virtual experiments in which any student has access provided that they have an Internet connection. No installation of any software is needed. The classic closed-loop of process control theory is presented illustratively and in a way that allows the user to interact with the application.";
$p1_3="The web application guides you throughout the conduction of each virtual experiment. At the beginning of each experiment you will find a guide on the relevant theory. The scope of the exercise and the steps needed for its completion are explained therein.";

$evaluation_p="All students may <a href=\"./login/\">login on VLAB</a> in order to acquire access to the evaluation of the results of their exercises. One may login either using an existing Google or Yahoo account or after creating an account on vlab. Then, once you have completed an exercise you can save it temporarily, overview it and then submit it for evaluation whenever you decide before the anounced deadline. All exercises are evaluated automatically and the degree is anounced privately to the user.";
