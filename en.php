$p1_1="VLAB is a web application that offers to its users an interactive environment for understanding in depth the basic principles of Process Control Theory.";
$p1_2="This virtual lab consists of a series of virtual experiments in which any student has access provided that they have an Internet connection. No installation of any software is needed. The classic closed-loop of process control theory is presented illustratively and in a way that allows the user to interact with the application.";
$p1_3="The web application guides you throughout the conduction of each virtual experiment. At the beginning of each experiment you will find a guide on the relevant theory. The scope of the exercise and the steps needed for its completion are explained therein.";
